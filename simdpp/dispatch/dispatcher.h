/** @def SIMDPP_USER_ARCH_INFO
    The user must define this macro if he wants to use the dispatcher
    infrastructure. The macro must evaluate to a constant expression that could
    implicitly initialize an object of type @c std::function<Arch()>.

    The macro is used by @c SIMDPP_MAKE_DISPATCHER_* to specify function which
    is invoked to determine which version of the dispatched function to
    dispatch. The macro is just a more convenient method to pass a parameter
    which has high chance to be the same in the majority of use cases. The user
    may redefine the macro and use different definitions for each site of
    @c SIMDPP_MAKE_DISPATCHER_* expansion.

    The function identified by the @c SIMDPP_USER_ARCH_INFO is called at the
    first time the specific dispatcher is invoked. The user must ensure that
    proper synchronization is used if the dispatcher is called concurrently.

    The user must ensure that the returned information is sensible: e.g. SSE2
    must be supported if SSE3 support is indicated.

    The @c simdpp/dispatch/get_arch_*.h files provide several ready
    implementations of CPU features detection.
