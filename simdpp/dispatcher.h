/** @macro SIMDPP_USER_ARCH_INFO
    User-definable macro that specifies user-defined way to get supported
    instruction sets of the current processor. If the macro is defined, this
    must be done before including simdpp/simd.h. The macro must evaluate to
    a constant expression that could implicitly initialize an object of type
    @c std::function<ArchUserInfo()>.

    The return value @a x (of type @c ArchUserInfo) is interpreted as follows:

    x.supported identifies features that are supported by the processor.
    x.unsupported identifies features that are not supported by the processor.

    If some features are defined as neither supported or not supported
    (any flags not set in the result of x.supported | x.unsupported), then the
    internal libsimdpp implementation is used to determine whether the current
    processor supports them or not.

    To override the internal libsimdpp implementation completely, set
    x.unsupported = ~x.supported.

    The user must ensure that the returned information is sensible: e.g. SSE2
    must be supported if SSE3 support is indicated.
